# CoffeeScript foray
-----
Oh man!!! Coffeescript is so much fun! 

This was my first ever .coffee attempt, it literally took me 10 minutes to install it on Ubuntu and get it working on my localhost. 

The only hangup I had was not being used to the unique function syntax, which resulted in an error in the javascript file on my first run. I had used

<pre>get_weekday (num) -></pre>

And it needed to be

<pre>get_weekday = (num) -></pre>

Notice the equals sign!
